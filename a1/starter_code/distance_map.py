===== Module Description =====

This module contains the class DistanceMap, which is used to store
and look up distances between cities. This class does not read distances
from the map file. (All reading from files is done in module experiment.)
Instead, it provides public methods that can be called to store and look up
distances.

    """ A map that is used to store and look up distances between cities

    === Private Attributes ===
    _map:
        A dictionary that stores the distance between cities. Each value
        represents the distance between two cities. The order of the cities
        matters.
        For example: Let <c1>, <c2> be the names of two cities, the distance
        between c1 and c2 is _map[c1c2] and the distance between c2 and c1
        is _map[c2c1].

    === Representation Invariants ===
    - _map only contains non-negative integer valuesã€‚
